## Re to NFA

* Convert regex articulation to postfix as indicated by predefined administrator precedence that is Shunting Yard.
* Articulation got in above advance goes through Thompson contruction to at long last create the e-NFA. Subtleties of the thompson development resemble we produce NFA's for various conditions(symbol,union,concatenation) and push them onto stack individually. At the point when we experience association or link in our appearance, we pop two NFAs out of the stack and club them together alongside the administrator. Presently the progress capacities created by clubbing them are added to the transition_function list.When we experience kleene administrator, the correspoinding epsilon nfa and the changes are driven into the transition_function list.

## NFA to DFA

*  a power set of the NFA states
* The epsilon closure set of the start state of the NFA is the start state of our DFA.
* All those states in the power states those include the final state of the NFA are the final states of the DFA.
* The transition function will be generated by taking the union of the transitions of a particular state in the power state.

## DFA to regex

* We need to deal with, If there exists any approaching edge to the underlying state, at that point make another underlying state having no approaching edge to it. Assuming there exists different last states in the DFA, convert every one of the last states into non-last states and make another single last state. In the event that there exists any cordial edge from the last state, make another last state having no friendly edge from it.
* then we eliminate the states. 
* Added a concatenation between the start state and the final transitions
* For states with a self transition, add a kleen star.
* add a union operator.

## Minimize DFA

* Remove all the dead, inaccessible states. 
* used equivalence theorem
* We stop once when there is no further partitioning required.
* Finally these partitions will be the states of the minimal dfa.
